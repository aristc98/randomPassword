# Password Generator 

## Description 
For this project, I am creating a password generator. People don't always want to create their own passwords for many reasons; random passwords are more secure than ones that could be personal to you, sometimes people need multiple passwords and don't want to spend time thinking of many passwords, sometimes you just don't want to put in the effort of creating a password, and etc. This password generator is designed to prompt users to choose password criteria of their preference, and the generator then generates a random password made up of the users preferred character types. 

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
To use this password generator, simply click the "generate password" button. You will then be prompted to choose password length and character types to include in your password. When prompted, enter the amount of characters you would like, and type "YES" or "NO" according to which character types you would like to include.
